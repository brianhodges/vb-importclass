# Use Class/Object File (Visual Basic)
Just a project more for myself to refer back to when working on future Visual Basic projects. Outputs an array of objects into a formatted .txt file.

# Setup
*To Run:*
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/brianhodges/vb-importclass
  cd vb-importclass
  ```
*Build/Run Project and a formatted log.txt file will output to the project /bin*
